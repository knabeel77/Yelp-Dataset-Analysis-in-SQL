Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
v. Review = 8090 (business_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 (id) 6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id)
ix. User = 10000 (id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, the two groups have different distribution of hours. Businesses with 4-5 star ratings are open for fewer hours when compared to businesses with 2-3 stars.	


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes, the two groups have different number of reviews. Businesses with more reviews are rated higher than the businesses with less reviews.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Since there are only 2 businesses in the output I got it is difficult to conclude if the location has anything to do with the ratings between the two groups.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
       CASE
       WHEN stars>=4 THEN '4-5 Stars'
       WHEN (stars>=2 AND stars<=3) THEN '2-3 Stars'
       END as rating,

       postal_code,
       review_count,
       hours.hours,
       name,
       neighborhood


FROM business INNER JOIN category
     ON business.id=category.business_id

     INNER JOIN hours
     ON business.id=hours.business_id

WHERE city='Las Vegas'
      AND category = 'Food'
      AND (stars>=4 OR (stars <3 and stars>2))

ORDER BY stars DESC, hours DESC

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

Closed businesses have an average rating that is lower than open businesses
         
         
ii. Difference 2:

Open businesses have a higher average review count when compared to closed businesses.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT 
    
    CASE
        WHEN is_open = 1 THEN 'Open'
        WHEN is_open = 0 THEN 'Closed'
    END AS status,
    AVG(stars) AS avg_star_rating,
    AVG(review_count) AS avg_review_count
    FROM
    business
GROUP BY
    status;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Informing an investment decision for an Arab Tycoon.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I have a client who want to invest $1 million into a business here in the States and he wants me to find a suitable business for him that is credible and well known. Therefore, to help him I have made a list of the names of businesses, the city and state they are located in and the category the business is in.

In order to adhere to his strict guidelines I have only selected businesses that have a minimum average star rating of 4.0 and have had atleast 100 reviews on average this will ensure the credibility of the business.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
